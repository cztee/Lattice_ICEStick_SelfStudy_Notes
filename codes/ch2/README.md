Note that for the VHDL code a "not" is added infront of the i_Switch_X, which is different from the book. This is because of the design of the PMOD module of SiPEED.
The button module of SiPEED is designed to conduct when the buttons are **NOT PRESSED**. When the buttons are **PRESSED**, the switch will conduct to the **GROUND**.
