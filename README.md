# Lattice_ICEStick_SelfStudy_Notes
This is my self-study notes for the Lattice ICEStick FPGA dev board. It is based on the book [Getting Started with FPGAs: Digital Circuit Design, Verilog, and VHDL for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-FPGAs-Russell-Merrick/dp/171850294X) by Russell Merrick. However, I do not own the GO board, which the book is based on. Also, I do not buy the PMOD breakout boards from the Digilent, as they are expansive. I use the PMOD modules produced by [SIPEED Tang](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-PMOD/FPGA_PMOD.html) instead. Therefore, I feel like there is a need to document the information scattered around the internet for the ease of my study and for those who faced the similar dilemma like I did, if this documentation turns out to be helpful. :)
